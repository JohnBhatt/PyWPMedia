## Why Use This Tool? ü§î

WordPress generates multiple thumbnail versions for every uploaded image, which can:
- Consume significant storage space
- Slow down backups
- Make manual organization difficult

This script helps you:
‚úî Automatically detect and delete thumbnails  
‚úî Preserve original uploaded images  
‚úî Organize remaining files into clean folders  
‚úî Save disk space (often 50-70% reduction)  

## Features ‚ú®

- Intelligent thumbnail detection (supports complex WordPress naming patterns)
- Preview mode to see what will be deleted
- Recursive folder scanning
- Handles multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- User-friendly GUI with progress logging
- Safe operations (never deletes originals)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnBhatt/PyWPMedia.git
   cd PyWPMedia
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python PyWPMedia.py
   ```

## Usage Guide üìñ
### Basic Cleaning
- Click "Browse" and select your WordPress uploads folder (typically /wp-content/uploads)

## Installation via Exe
I have created a exe version of this and you can download from release section. If you have Python and other tools installed and wish to create executable yourself, download the repository in your machine and run this command in terminal. 
```bash
pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed PyWPMedia.py
```

## Advanced Options ‚ö°
### Command Line Version
For server use without GUI:
   ```bash
   python PyWPMedia.py --path /path/to/uploads --auto 
```

### Options:

- path: Specify uploads folder  
- auto: Run without confirmation  
- move: Specify destination folder  
- preview: Only show what would be deleted  

## How It Works üîç
The tool uses intelligent pattern matching to identify thumbnails:

### Detects WordPress naming patterns:  
- filename-1024x768.jpg  
- filename-scaled.jpg  
- filename-150x150.jpg.webp  

### Matches thumbnails to originals using:  
- Base filename matching  
- Dimension pattern analysis  
- Multiple extension handling  

### Safety checks ensure:
- No original files are deleted  
- Files without matches are preserved  
- Complex naming patterns are handled  

## FAQ ‚ùì
Q: Is this safe to use on my live site?  
A: Always back up your uploads folder first. The tool is designed to be safe, but backups are essential.  

Q: Will this break my existing media links?  
A: It only removes files WordPress automatically generates. Post attachments and featured images remain intact.  

Q: Can I recover deleted files?  
A: Only if you have a backup. Deleted thumbnails can always be regenerated by WordPress.  

Q: Does this work with multisite?
A: Yes! Run it on each site's uploads folder separately.
